    <string name="dialog_turn_start_info">At the start of each of your turns, take these steps in any order you choose:\n\n\n
&#8226; If you created an effect lasting for a certain number of rounds, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0.\n\n
&#8226; You can use 1 free action or reaction with a trigger of “Your turn begins” or something similar.\n\n
&#8226; If you are dying, roll a recovery check.\n\n
&#8226; Do anything else that is specified to happen at the start of your turn, such as regaining Hit Points from fast healing or regeneration.\n\n\n
The last step of starting your turn is always the same.\n\n\n
&#8226; Regain your 3 actions and 1 reaction. If you have not spent your reaction from your last turn, you lose it—you can not “save” actions or reactions from one turn to use during the next turn. If a condition prevents you from being able to act, you don not regain any actions or your reaction. Some abilities or conditions (such as quickened and slowed) can change how many actions you regain and whether you regain your reaction. If you lose actions and gain additional actions (such as if you are both quickened and slowed), you choose which actions to lose.</string>
    <string name="dialog_turn_start_info_title">Start Your Turn info</string>
    <string name="dialog_turn_end_info">Take the following steps in any order you choose. Play then proceeds to the next creature in the initiative order.\n\n\n
&#8226; End any effects that last until the end of your turn. For example, spells with a sustained duration end at the end of your turn unless you used the Sustain a Spell action during your turn to extend them. Some effects caused by enemies might also last through a certain number of your turns, and you decrease the remaining duration by 1 during this step, ending the effect if its duration is reduced to 0.\n\n
&#8226; If you have a persistent damage condition, you take the damage at this point. After you take the damage, you can attempt the flat check to end the persistent damage. You then attempt any saving throws for ongoing afflictions. Many other conditions change at the end of your turn, such as the frightened condition decreasing in severity. These take place after you have taken any persistent damage, attempted flat checks to end the persistent damage, and attempted saves against any afflictions.\n\n
&#8226; You can use 1 free action or reaction with a trigger of “Your turn ends” or something similar.\n\n
&#8226; Resolve anything else specified to happen at the end of your turn.</string>
